# Student Score Prediction

Student Score Prediction is a data science project designed to estimate student performance based on various input features using supervised machine learning techniques. This project aims to assist educators and institutions in identifying patterns in student achievement and predicting scores, enabling more targeted academic support and intervention.

## Project Description

This project utilizes regression algorithms to predict student scores from a dataset containing relevant features such as study hours and other academic indicators. Through comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling, the project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to forecast outcomes and gain insights into factors influencing student performance. The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare raw student data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and highlight relationships between variables.
- Implementation of regression models (such as Linear Regression) for score prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Visualization of results for clear interpretation and reporting.

## Tools Used

- **Python 3.x:** Core programming language for data processing and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive platform for code, visualization, and narrative analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and organization.
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualization libraries for exploratory and result-oriented plotting.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for regression modeling, data splitting, and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and structures the student dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes data distributions and correlations among features.
- **Regression Modeling:** Builds and trains predictive models to estimate student scores.
- **Result Visualization:** Graphically presents predictions versus actual scores.
- **Insight Generation:** Interprets findings to support data-driven educational strategies.

## Project Structure

- Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step data analysis and modeling.
- Data files for input and prediction tasks.
- Visualization outputs for enhanced understanding and reporting.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
